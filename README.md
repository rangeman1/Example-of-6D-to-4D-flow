Visualisation created from the six-dimentional table representing weather parameters in the USA in 2014 year: 1. Avarage temp from min and max values; 2. SDEV from minimal and maximal temp values; 3. Avarage humidity from min and max values; 4. SDEV from minimal and maximal humidity values; 5. Avarage level of rainfall from min and max values; 6. SDEV from minimal and maximal level of rainfall values. Data from table were used for creation of four dimentional table, ready for subsequent graphical presentation in the CSPACE 1.0.1.26 software.
